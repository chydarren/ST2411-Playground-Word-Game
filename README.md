# Playground Word Game (2 Player)

## Introduction

This is a Python program that simulates a two player word game. The program will first prompt the players to enter their names to start a 
new game session. A game session begins by showing an initial challenging word (randomly picked by the program). Each player will then 
take turn to enter a new word in response to the challenge based on the game rules and earn points.
